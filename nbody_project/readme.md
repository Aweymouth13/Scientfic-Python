# N-Body Simulation with Astropy and Matplotlib

## 1. A brief Summary Summar of our project and why we are doing it
- This project invloves creating a python simulation of 'celestial bodies' under gravitational influences visualised and logged to a csv.
- The purpose was to demonstrate the dynamics of celestial/astronomical systems.
- This project shows the heavy overlap between physics, data analysis, and visualization in a computational setting.
- We have no doubt there are a many better (and more accruate) simulations readily avaliable to the public however, this really let us test our knowledge of some very important libraries (numpy, astropy et. al.) and how they can interact to futher the scientific body of knowledge.

## 2. A list of python packages used in our project
- Default/Standard Libraries: csv, typing
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (pyplot and ani)
- Astropy

## 3. Source code for any packages written
- Self contained code in `main.py`
- You will find all functions defined with docstrings at the top, and a main call at the bottom.

## 4. A written Presentation of our results:


## 5. Clear Instructions on how to run the code:
- Ensure main.py is in a python environment with the given packages avaliable (Astropy, Matplotlib, Numpy)
- This will not run sucessfully in an ipython env as the animation will not display, please use default python or an ide.
- The 3D matplotlib SC should appear and run course, it will also save a file called `data.csv` to the directory folder where it is being ran.
